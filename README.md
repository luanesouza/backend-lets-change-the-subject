## Getting Started
For development, you will only need Ruby on Rails and Postgres, which depends on Homebrew and Ruby. 

#### Node installation on OS X

You will need to use a Terminal. On OS X, you can find the default terminal in
`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

    ```
    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

2. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/):
```
    $ brew install rbenv ruby-build
    # Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
    $ echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
    $ source ~/.bash_profile

    # Install Ruby
    $ rbenv install 2.7.1
    $ rbenv global 2.7.1
    $ ruby -v
```
3. Install [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
```
    $ gem install rails -v 6.0.2.2
```

4. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
```
    $ brew install postgresql
```
